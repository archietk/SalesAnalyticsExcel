# Data-Driven Insights with Microsoft Excel: AtliQ Hardwares Analytics Project

Welcome to the **AtliQ Hardwares Data Analytics Project** repository. This project presents two cornerstone reports of data-driven decision-making: **Sales Analytics** and **Finance Analytics**. By leveraging the advanced functionalities of **Microsoft Excel**—including Power Query, Power Pivot, and DAX—this analysis uncovers actionable insights to drive performance improvements, streamline operations, and empower strategic decisions for AtliQ Hardwares, a fictional global hardware manufacturer.

## Overview

AtliQ Hardwares operates in diverse markets across the globe, dealing with multiple products, divisions and distributors. However, challenges like inconsistent sales performance, unmet targets, and opaque profitability required in-depth analysis to inform decision-making and strategic planning. This project solves these challenges through two sub-projects:

1. **[Sales Analytics](https://github.com/archietk/SalesAnalyticsExcel/blob/main/Consolidated%20Sales%20Analytics%20Reports%20-%20AtliQ%20Hardwares.pdf)**: Focusing on customer and market performance over three years (2019–2021).
2. **[Finance Analytics](https://github.com/archietk/SalesAnalyticsExcel/blob/main/Consolidated%20Finance%20Analytics%20Report%20-%20AtliQ%20Hardwares.pdf)**: Breaking down profitability and financial performance using Profit & Loss (P&L) reports for these 3 years. 


**NOTE:** AtliQ Hardwares follows a fiscal cycle that runs from September through August.
